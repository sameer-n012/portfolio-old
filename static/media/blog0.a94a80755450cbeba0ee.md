As I'm making this portfolio website, I'm still not really sure what I'm ever going to write
here. Although theres no shortage of things right now to write about, it feels counter to the
idea of this blog to write a paragraph merely because I need to test the website. Although I do
find a lot of fun in building UIs using React and Redux, I think I'm also getting slightly bored
of adjusting bootstrap classes to center elements or changing color schemes. As a result, yesterday
I put down Visual Studio Code (where I do web development) and opened instead Jupyter Notebook to
play around with some data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Hopefully I'll be done with web development for
some time when I finish the blog section and then I can fully turn to learning more A.I.

I am taking 18 credits this semester so I'm not entirely sure how much free time I will have, but
none of my classes have assigned a lot of work so far. As I get further into the semester and run
into midterms before Spring Break it may get a lot more busy, so I might not have much time
I'll have to work on personal projects after this. Anyways, this looks like a large enough paragraph
from where I'm reading in a text editor, so I think I can conclude my first blog post here.
