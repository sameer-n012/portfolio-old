	aboutMeDescription: `I'm Sameer Narendran, a second-year student at the University of Wisconsin Madison
                        studying Computer Science and Math. My primary interest is in AI and neural networks, 
                        but I also enjoy working on software projects in Java as well as full-stack 
                        applications. When I'm not in class or on my computer, I can usually 
                        be found reading science fiction novels or playing tennis outside with my friends.`,
